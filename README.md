# raspberry-pi-nas
  
This project implements a personal Network-Attached Storage (NAS) system with secure VPN access for remote connectivity on a Raspberry Pi. It acts as your private storage, always accessible allowing you to store, access, and share files over your network. A Python script enables automated weekly and monthly backups, ensuring your data is regularly and reliably saved.

## üß≠ Project Goals
    
- üíæ **Centralized file storage and backup**  
  Provide a reliable way to store and back up personal files on a Raspberry Pi-powered NAS
- üïí **Scheduled** backups  
  Automatically back up data (e.g. from a laptop or phone) to the NAS on a regular schedule
- üåç **Remote access from anywhere**  
  Enable secure access to stored data globally via a VPN connection
- üì± **Cross-device compatibility**  
  Ensure access to files from various devices (PCs, smartphones, tablets) regardless of the operating system
- üóÇÔ∏è **Web-based file interface**  
  Set up a browser-accessible interface (e.g. Nextcloud or File Browser) for convenient file management
- üíª **Execute programs remotely**  
  Allow execution of program files (e.g. Python scripts -> toolbox) directly on the Raspberry Pi without needing to download them
- üéÆ **Game storage and remote access**  
  Explore the feasibility of storing games on the NAS and running them remotely, possibly via streaming or network mounts
- üîê **User-specific access control**  
  Implement user account management with customizable access rights and folder-level permissions
